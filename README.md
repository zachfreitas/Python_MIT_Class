### Common operations on numerical types 
$i+j$ is the sum of $i$ and $j$. /n
$iâ€“j$ is $i$ minus $j$. 
$i*j$ is the product of $i$ and $j$. 
$i//j$ is integer division. 
$i/j$ is floating point division. 
$i%j$ is the remainder when the int $i$ is divided by the int $j$. 
$i**j$ is $i$ raised to the power $j$. 
$x += y$ is equivalent to $x = x + y$. $*=$ and $-=$ work the same way. 

### Comparison and Boolean operators 
x == y returns True if x and y are equal. 
x != y returns True if x and y are not equal. 
<, >, <=, >= have their usual meanings. 
a and b is True if both a and b are True, and False otherwise. 
a or b is True if at least one of a or b is True, and False otherwise. 
not a is True if a is False, and False if a is True. 

### Common operations on sequence types 
seq[i] returns the ith element in the sequence. 
len(seq) returns the length of the sequence. 
seq1 + seq2 concatenates the two sequences. (Not available for ranges.) 
n*seq returns a sequence that repeats seq n times. (Not available for ranges.) 
seq[start:end] returns a slice of the sequence. 
e in seq tests whether e is contained in the sequence. 
e not in seq tests whether e is not contained in the sequence. 
for e in seq iterates over the elements of the sequence.
